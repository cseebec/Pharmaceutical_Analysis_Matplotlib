# Pharmaceutical_Analysis_Matplotlib
This repo is focused on using Matplotlib to visualize python data in various different ways. 
The data for this repo is from a hypothetical test on mice to test the effects of different drugs in reducing tumors. 
This data is from a csv file that is also stored in this repo. 

# Dependencies used
The first step to almost every python coding file is to import the dependencies that will be used in the code. 
For this code I used matplotlib to create plots 
I used pandas to read in the csv files to dataframes 
I used scipy to calculate the standard error, correlation coefficient, and linear regression. 
I used numpy to calculate other statistics such as the quartiles 
I used randrange to randomly generate an integer value
