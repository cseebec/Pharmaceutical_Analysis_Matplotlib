# Pharmaceutical_Analysis_Matplotlib
This repo is focused on using Matplotlib to visualize python data in various ways. 
The data for this repo is from a hypothetical test on mice to test the effects of different drugs in reducing tumors. 
This data is from a csv file that is also stored in this repo. 

## System Requirements 
The following are softwares required for this repo: 
- Word 
- CSV Files 
- Python 3 
- Jupyter Lab (Need Python3 on Jupyter Lab) 

The following are libraries in python that you need to have installed on your computer to execute the code in this repo
- matplotlib
- pandas
- scipy
- numpy
- random


## Conclusions
1. There is a strong positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin drug regimen. This is shown by the calculation that the coefficient of correlation between the 2 variables is 0.84

2. The 2 most consistent drug regimens in the study were Capomulin and Ramicane. This is shown by the fact that these drugs have the 2 lowest standard variations. Additionally, neither has any outliers. 

3. The study was evenly distributed between male and female mice
